AirBnB_clone
This project is about making the console part of an AirBnB website clone.
In order to use the console, run the console file ./console.py.
To use it, you can use the following commands:
- quit or Ctr+D: to end the session.
- create class name: to create a new instance.
- destroy: destroy a cpecific instance based on class and id.
- show ClassName id: show a cpecific instance based on class and id.
- all: prints all instances.
- update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>": to update an attribute to a new value.
You can also use another syntax: ClassName.command().
For instance, if you want to how all instance under the User class, you can either type: All User, or User.all().
